Michael Userbot is Open Source software open to development. 
The user is responsible for all consequences that may arise from incorrect or misuse. 
Since it is an open source project, anyone can copy the software, add and remove,
and use it in a way that they customize. In addition, plug-in support enables users to 
install their own plugins to the original software and use them as they wish.
Using the bot out of purpose will explicitly ban you.
Usage is entirely the user's responsibility, Michael Userbot is an 
infrastructure only. Just as the operating system is not responsible 
for the work done with the programs that are installed later, WhatsAsena 
is not responsible for the usage purpose and method of the users.
Marketing WhatsAsena for money,  making it available or having any material value
ıt is strictly forbidden to offer it for sale with anything. All legal investigations that may arise
the user is responsible..
